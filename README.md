QN.1 TO PRINT IF GIVEN NUMBER IS ODD OR EVEN In order to print odd or even we need to take modulus of user input and compare with 0 whether it is equal or not. If equal the output is even ,if not the output will be odd.

QN.2 TO PRINT EACH CHARACTER GIVEN BY USER. In this we treat the string given by user as array of characters and print individual characters using for loop.

QN.3 SIMPLE CALCULATOR Here we use input type of field to get numbers from use and we write buttons for theri respective task. we get the string from user and convert that to integer using parseInt(); and perform the respective calculation

QN 4 TO PRINT REVERSE OF GIVEN STRING In this the logic is same as qn no 2 but the looping part is opposite where we decrease the looping variable from high to low in the script tag.

QN.1 TO ALTER VISIBILITY OF AN IMAGE IN HTML USING JAVASCRIPT. In order to alter visibility of any element we use css. Frist we set up a fuction to alter the element and call using onclick="function name()" Then we program the function to alter the visibility using .style.display//.style.visibility

QN.2 TO ILLUSTRATE ELEMENT POSITIONING ANS STACKING ELEMENTS. In stacking the 'top' , 'left' properties of css alloe the placement of an element anywhere in the two dimention display of a document . The placement of elements in third dimension is controlled by z-index attributr of the element. We use z-index to give the view of stacking to the client. To make more interactive we use javascript to provide a clicking mechanism to change the element(for eg : images ) position on clicking them.

QN.3 DYNAMIC CONTENT Websites provides many contents at a time . As we can cleraly observe from many sites.If we click on somethings it immediatly changes or points to another documents ehich illustrates the application if dynamic content . It can be achieved by hyperlinks , javascript ,css ,php,etc

QN.4 DRAG AND DROP One of the powerful event handeling is allowing user to drag and drop elements around the display screen. The mouseup,mousedown,and mousemove events can be used to implement changing top and left properties of an element .

QN.5 FORM VALIDATION Form validation is the process of checking that a form has been filled in correctly before it is processed. For example, if your form has a box for the user to type their email address, you might want your form handler to check that they've filled in their address before you deal with the rest of the form. There are two main methods for validating forms: server-side (using CGI scripts, ASP, etc), and client-side (usually done using JavaScript). Server-side validation is more secure but often more tricky to code and it also increases load of server computer, whereas clientside (JavaScript) validation is easier to do and quicker too (the browser doesn't have to connect to the server to validate the form, so the user finds out instantly if they've missed out that required field!) and it also decreases the load of server computer and hence server computer can focus on business logic processing.
